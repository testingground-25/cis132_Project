        I am Gabriela Ruelas and I am interested in becoming a software developer. I have a bachelor's 
        in Business Administration. What caused me to consider pursuing this careers was a CIS class I 
        had taken in my 3<sup>rd</sup> year in college. I loved the coding we had done in Excel that 
        after all these years I have had the itch of one day learning more regarding programming. So 
        far, I am having fun learning about HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had seen El Camino offers a 
        building mobile app class that I hope to take this winter or spring semester!
